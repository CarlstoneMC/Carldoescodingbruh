- My Projects...

Currently I'm working on Carl OS, an android based operating system that is made
specifically for people with older smartphones or any smartphone for that matter
that isn't getting updates for Android. Carl OS will be easy to install without
requiring the user to unlock the bootloader or use TWRP by modifying packages
via local ADB.

I'm also working on a Linux distro called Snap OS (Not to be confused with Canonical's Snap)
I am trying to make Snap OS run on systems with as low as 512MB of ram and 0.3GHz processor
clock speed. I am trying to make this Linux distro a complete GUI experience
so no messing with the command line, also I will make it as compatible as
can be with Windows programs by modding a a windows iso file to make it as light as possible with only the core components to run software. I will also provide different layout options like Mac, Windows, Linux, etc. to make the user comfortable no matter which OS they came from.
