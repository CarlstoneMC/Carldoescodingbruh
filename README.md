- My Projects...

Currently I'm working on Carl OS, an android based operating system that is made
specifically for people with older smartphones or any smartphone for that matter
that isn't getting updates for Android. Carl OS will be easy to install without
requiring the user to unlock the bootloader or use TWRP by modifying packages
via local ADB.

I'm also working on a Linux distro I don't have a name for yet which is gonna
be able to run on systems with as low as 512mb of ram and 3000mhz processor
clock speed. I am trying to make this Linux distro a complete GUI experience
so no messing with the command line, also I will make it as compatible as
can be with Windows programs. I will also provide different layout options
like Mac, Windows, Linux, etc. to make the user comfortable no matter which
OS they came from.
