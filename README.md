- My Projects...

Currently I'm working on Carl OS, an android based operating system that is made
specifically for people with older smartphones or any smartphone for that matter
that isn't getting updates for Android. Carl OS will be easy to install without
requiring the user to unlock the bootloader or use TWRP by modifying packages
via locally simulating ADB. There will also be a version called Carl OS Simplify 
which is made to remove the bloat put into phones by OEMs and give the simple 
pixel-like experience they deserve.

I'm also working on a Windows based operating system called Snap OS (Not to be confused with Canonical's Snap for Linux)
Snap OS based on Windows 10/11 can run on systems with low end specs and provide more features. There are 3 versions of Snap OS,
Snap OS for mid-range/lower mid-range PC's based on Windows 11 providing amazing performance with astonishing new features.
Snap OS LITE for low-end/entry-level based on Windows 10 providing snappy performance even on the lowest of specs and finally
Snap OS BAREBONE which comes in Windows 7/7X/10/10L/11 editions and is mainly designed for organization/server use as no extra
features are provided and only performance improvements and Snap OS toolkit remain.
EDIT - Due to legal issues I can no longer put Snap OS up for download with custom ISO's, I am only allowed to create modifications
in a genuine installed Windows ISO by using a Windows debloater toolking style program. Snap OS will be up again soon just with a
different style.
