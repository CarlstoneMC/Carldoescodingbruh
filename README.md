- My Projects...

Currently I'm working on Carl OS, an android based operating system that is made
specifically for people with older smartphones or any smartphone for that matter
that isn't getting updates for Android. Carl OS will be easy to install without
requiring the user to unlock the bootloader or use TWRP by modifying packages
via local ADB. There will also be a version called Carl OS Simplify which is 
made to remove the bloat put into phones by OEMs and give the simple pixel-like
experience they deserve.

I'm also working on a Windows bases operating system called Snap OS (Not to be confused with Canonical's Snap for Linux)
I am trying to make Snap OS run on systems with as low as 512MB of ram and 0.3GHz processor clock speed. I will also provide
different layout options like Mac, Windows, Linux, etc. to make the user comfortable no matter which OS they came from. I will
also make another version of Snap OS named Snap OS Crystal Edition, this is a special version of Snap OS made for the people with
high end computers that have to comprimise with features/appearance just because Windows has normalised 1 OS for everyone.
Snap OS Crystal Edition will provide a beautiful appearance and tons of amazing features and customizations.
