Currently I'm working on Carl OS, an android based operating system that is made
specifically for people with older smartphones or any smartphone for that matter
that isn't getting updates for Android. Carl OS will be easy to install without
requiring the user to unlock the bootloader or use TWRP by modifying packages
via local ADB. There will also be a version called Carl OS Simplify which is 
made to remove the bloat put into phones by OEMs and give the simple pixel-like
experience they deserve.

I'm also working on a Windows bases operating system called Snap OS (Not to be confused with Canonical's Snap for Linux)
Snap OS based on Windows 10/11 can run on systems with low end specs and provide more features. There are 3 versions of Snap OS,
Snap OS for mid-range/lower mid-range PC's based on Windows 11 providing amazing performance with astonishing new features.
Snap OS LITE for low-end/entry-level based on Windows 10 providing snappy performance even on the lowest of specs and finally
Snap OS BAREBONE which comes in Windows 7/7X/10/10L/11 editions and is mainly designed for organization/server use as no extra
features are provided and only performance improvements and Snap OS toolkit remain. All versions can be downloaded from
bit.ly/getsnapos for Snap OS
bit.ly/getsnaplite for Snap OS LITE
bit.ly/getsnapbarebore for Snap OS BAREBONE and finally
bit.ly/aboutsnapos for more info on all versions of Snap OS
