- My Projects...

Currently I'm working on Carl OS, an android based operating system that is made
specifically for people with older smartphones or any smartphone for that matter
that isn't getting updates for Android. Carl OS will be easy to install without
requiring the user to unlock the bootloader or use TWRP by modifying packages
via locally simulating ADB. There will also be a version called Carl OS Simplify 
which is made to remove the bloat put into phones by OEMs and give the simple 
pixel-like experience they deserve.

I'm also working on a Windows based operating system called Snap OS (Not to be confused with Canonical's Snap for Linux)
Snap OS based on Windows 10/11 can run on systems with low end specs and provide more features. There will be two different
versions of Snap OS, Regular Snap OS which is focused more on features for mid-range/high-end PC's and Snap OS LITE which is
made to increase performance for low-end/entry-level PC's. Snap OS Will not use any illegal custom ISO but a simple toolkit
to install the different features.

Note - Both these projects are not completed yet.
